        <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>
        <img src="img/lovelace.png"image of ada lovelace" id="imgAda">
            <p class="description"><strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> (1815-1852) was born Augusta Ada Byron, 
                the only legitimate child of Annabella Milbanke and 
                the poet Lord Byron. Her mother, Lady Byron, 
                had mathematical training (Byron called her his 'Princess of Parallelograms') 
                and insisted that Ada, who was tutored privately, study mathematics too - an 
                unusual education for a woman.</p>
            <p class="description">Ada met Babbage at a party in 1833 when she was seventeen and was entranced 
                when Babbage demonstrated the small working section of the Engine to her. 
                She intermitted her mathematical studies for marriage and motherhood but 
                resumed when domestic duties allowed. In 1843 she published a translation 
                from the French of an article on the Analytical Engine by an Italian engineer, 
                Luigi Menabrea, to which Ada added extensive notes of her own. The Notes
                included the first published description of a stepwise sequence of 
                operations for solving certain mathematical problems and Ada is often 
                referred to as <em>'the first programmer'</em>.</p>

            <h3>Important Points about Ada Lovelace</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Ada Lovelace's teacher introduced her to Charles Babbage(father of the computer) in 1833, 
                    their friendship grew strong with time. Later she became interested in his work 
                    "Difference Engine".</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Charles Babbage delivered a lecture on his invention "Analytical Engine" at 'University of Turin' 
                    in the year 1840. A Luigi Menabrea, an Italian writer, wrote his above lecture in French, 
                    which was printed two years later in 'Bibliotheque universelle de Genève'</li>
                    <br>
                <li>Ada Lovelace translated his lecture to English as requested by Charles Whetstone. 
                    In the year 1842-43, Lovelace added points of her own analysis to the above-transcribed paper.
                    The points she added are as follow:
                    <br><br>
                    a. She claimed Babbage's "Analytical Engine" is more advanced than other calculating machines, 
                    and it can perform a plethora of operations other than numerical calculations.
                    <br><br>
                    b. She wrote an algorithm to calculate Bernoulli's number for Babbage's "Analytical Engine". 
                    It is known to be the world's first ever algorithm in computer programming. 
                    <br><br>
                    c. She also wrote about the drawbacks of "Analytical Engine", now considered the predecessor of debugging.

            <h3>Achievements</h3>
            <p>She is the first person to write the first algorithm program for Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine to calculate 
            Bernoulli's number. Every year, the second Tuesday of October, is celebrated as Ada lovelace day in her honor. 
            It is an international celebration of women’s achievements in the Science, Technology, Engineering, 
            and math(STEM) field.</p>

            <h3>Words of Admiration</h3>  
            <p>We know that most of the honorable people that we admire in our life are men. Ada Lovelace was an inspiration to 
            all women. Her life proved that women were also innovative, brilliant, and inventors. As a programmer student, 
            I admire her humility and dedication. She did not look down on herself as a woman and pursue what she wanted to do. 
            For me, Ada Lovelace was one of the memorable historic women because she was the first programmer. She was the first 
            one who thought and realized that a computer follows a set of instructions called algorithms. Her invention was now 
            the foundation of all software and hardware applications that we all enjoy today.</p>
