        <p>These videos awaken my learning about JavaScript.
            I just only heard the term JavaScript and did not knowledge 
            of what its functions and behaviors are. Moreover, 
            Vanilla JavaScript is just simply plain JavaScript 
            means without the need to use libraries or frameworks. 
            As I watched these videos, I learned when and how 
            JavaScript started. JavaScript is now usually used
            by Web Developers because most of the websites are
            supported and performed by JavaScript. It is also
            easier to use because programmers didn't need to
            install any IDE compilers JavaScript can perform 
            within the browsers. Based on what I received, 
            JavaScript helps the website or webpages to 
            become dynamic, interactive, and have complex behaviors.</p>
