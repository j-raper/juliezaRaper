        <p>These videos awaken my learning about JavaScript. I heard the term JavaScript and 
            did not have enough knowledge of what its functions and behaviors are. Moreover, 
            Vanilla JavaScript is just simply plain JavaScript means without the need to use 
            libraries or frameworks. As I watched these videos, I learned when and how 
            JavaScript started. JavaScript is now usually used by Web Developers
            because most websites are supported and performed by JavaScript. It
            is also easier to use because programmers didn't need to install any 
            IDE compilers. JavaScript is within the browsers. Based on what I received, JavaScript
            helps the website or webpages to become dynamic, interactive, and have complex behaviors.</p>
